# Happy Friday!

Yesterday I couldn't stop thinking around the data models.  I want to do a little more digging into the accounts and data today then do those basic steps I listed yesterday.

## Plan

- Create Data models
  - I'm going to opt for a simpler start at first instead of just copying big queries tables
  - We don't need all the data, just the useful bits
  - Expand models as additional use-cases are discovered
- Continue working on the Django project
  - there is a plugin called django-sql-dashboard that makes it simple to create a suite of pre-formatted useful queries with integrated charts. https://django-sql-dashboard.datasette.io/en/stable/
- In addition to creating my first simple DAGs pulling data from the APIs:
  - I want to improve my airflow infrastructure and use a container based approach with local volume mounts for simple addition and modification of code and configuration
  - This also is a good approach for reproducing consistent dev environments and for scaling the system up for production installations.
- Expand on Data models as I explore the account data

## Some insight in how I like to take notes and horde information:
- I use Obsidian and publish my notes to a github repo call memento https://github.com/codyaverett/memento
- I use a reMarkable e-ink notebook to handwrite ideas and draw diagrams
- These daily posts, I'm using them to plan out and guide me through the day. Similar to a daily standup
- I'd typically also use a project management system like Jira, Github projects, or whatever others I'm working with are using.

## Another interesting thing I found yesterday:
- I learned a bit about how malicious bots front-run transactions

- I created a simple smart contract to test this on the Milkomeda EVM
  - Disappointingly my transactions were not front-run
