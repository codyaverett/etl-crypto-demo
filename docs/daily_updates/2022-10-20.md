Good Thursday morning!

I have a few appointments to attend this morning and early afternoon, so I'll be working when I'm through with those in the afternoon.
I spent a few hours yesterday getting the basic project set up and clearing up some project details with 
@Dave

Here is the public GitHub repo I'll be using for this project.
https://github.com/codyaverett/etl-crypto-demo

Later today I plan to:
- Create a data models for my db (Postgres as data warehouse)
- Create a simple Django RestFramework ViewSet for my data models (CRUD API basically is free)
- Create some general DAGs to pull data from Ethscan and etc.
Are there any data elements you all are specifically interested in from the accounts you provided?
I will start with the obvious.. account balances and expand from there.
