# Greetings and Happy Tuesday

It is raining here today, but that's okay because I'm gonna be working from home.

## Yesterday
- Had a good chat with Dave about the project and ideas for some data
- Learned about Fair Sequencing Services from Ari Juels' presentation
- Looked through some dune dashboards https://dune.com/browse/dashboards

## Today Data Day 1
I will call today "DATA DAY 1", because that's all I'll be foucsing on.
This is the final leg of the race, but I'll likely walk it over the next few days.

- Finalize and formalize and the data questions I'll answer in superset.
- Forming datamodels that can answer those questions
- Pulling data for those models
- Adding charts to superset

## Tomorrow (wednesday)
I'll be taking tomorrow off mostly to celebrate my yearly wedding anniversary.
