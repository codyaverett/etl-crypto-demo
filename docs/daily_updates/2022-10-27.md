# Happy Thursday! Data Day 2 

Small update for today, because I'm generally continuing what I mentioned on Tuesday.

- I'm using Django ORM to manage and maintain my database schemas and relationships (Looked into DBT which I heard you all use, but I wanted to continue with my own approach for this project)

- I'm maintaining an airflow operator for querying database via the exposed Django API.
 
- I'm primarily interested in looking at data over time for accounts
  - to perhaps see some patterns
  - to perhaps forecast some trends
  - to perhaps uncover some anomalies in the data
