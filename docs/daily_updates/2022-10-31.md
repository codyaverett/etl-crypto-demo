Happy Halloween!!

# Data day 4

## On Friday and over the weekend 
- Updated configs in airflow to use localExecutor
- Loaded accounts into db with watch flag
- I worked on a few timeseries based queries on price data I already had to:
  - calculate moving averages
  - prices by trading pairs
- Learned a lot about superset (glad you all mentioned it to me)

## Today 
- I have a scheduled meeting with @Dave at 3pm CST
- I need to pull a lot more data related to accounts
- Want to use the multi address query and batch requests with 20 accounts at a time vs requesting them individually
- Types of data I planned to collect
  - assets/tokens associated to each account over time
  - account transactions
  - account internal transactions
  - account type/categorization
  - notes for each account

## Additional notes
- A secret management solution which Dave mentioned to me last week would have come in handy vs using airflow variables
- Operators and hooks were kind of cumbersome to work with immediately so I opted to use task decorators with python functions for simpler branching tasks
  - I would invest more time to use these types of abstractions if I have more time to consider their configuration and additional use cases
