# Busy Friday 

I have some morning appointments and a halloween party sandwiched around my working hours today.
So I'll be continuing at pace for a few hours during my afternoon for Data day 3 .

I'd like to schedule one more chat with Dave on Monday to see what you think of my contributions since our last chat.
